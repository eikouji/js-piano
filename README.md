# Dev's notes #
This is based on a youtube tutorial. While this tutorial was a great launching point, I did the best I could to make sure that
 * the notes on the keyboard were more accurate to that of a real piano or keyboard. 
 * when clicking on a note, the sound was not only accurate but responsive to clicks. 
 * The C3 note on my piano app sounds like the C3 note of a real piano, the C#3 note sounds like C#3, and so on.
 * I could code a piano app with at least one complete C to C scale, with black AND white keys.
